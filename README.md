## ✨ Key Insights

- **Ticket Price vs Revenue:**  
  2017 sold the most tickets but ranked third in revenue due to a lower average ticket price.  
  In contrast, 2022 had fewer tickets sold but earned the most revenue, thanks to higher prices.  
  2024 had the lowest sales but still strong revenue, suggesting a post-pandemic “revenge entertainment” trend.

- **Daily Attendance Trends:**  
  Peak daily attendance was 24K in 2017 (Day 2). After expanding to 3 days, attendance became more balanced across all days.  
  No consistent pattern on most-attended days, showing artist lineups matter more than weekdays/weekends.

- **Ticket Type Preferences:**  
  Multi-Day Passes were dominant until 2024, when Daily Passes overtook them for the first time.  
  VIP ticket sales rose gradually over time, showing growing demand for premium experiences.

- **Audience Geography:**  
  Most attendees are from Indonesia, followed by Singapore and Malaysia.  
  These regional markets are key due to the limited availability of large music festivals in their home countries.
